## The problem 👎

Video conferencing with large monitors and light-colored apps are a recipe for washed out faces in web cams. This tool can help balance that out by simulating different color temperatures 

## How to get started 🚀

1️⃣ Visit [keylight.alexlehner.com](https://keylight.alexlehner.com)

2️⃣ Select a temperature that matches your time of day

3️⃣ Make your browser fill your screen

4️⃣ If needed, overlay any windows or apps in the middle. 

## What's a key light? 🔑

## Development ⚛️

To run this locally, you'll want git, node, and npm already installed. Then, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexlehner/key-light.git
```

Enter the directory and install dependencies

```bash
cd key-light && npm i
```

Then get the dev server running. This'll launch a web browser at http://localhost:3000. 

```bash
npm start
```
